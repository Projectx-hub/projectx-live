One of ProjectX's core values is to promote work from the community. As we were putting together our site, [projectx.is](https://projectx.is), we realised we needed images. Of course, we didn't need to hit up Unsplash. Nor did we need to look to IG.

We are a community of artists. Our gratification comes from sharing the art that we create. So to break the ice, we sent to the team a call for photographs to adorn our new site.

Here's a short montage of photographs from our first contributors.

#### Short Bio

My father was an avid photographer. He gave me his Minolta SRT 101 and taught me the basics. This was around 1982 in Youngstown, Ohio.

I loved that camera because I could manually play with exposures and make my photos look different from everyone elses. I passed it down to my daughter who still uses it today.

I've contributed to microstock companies, Airbnb Plus, and editorial magazines. I run a donation-based street photography tour in Ubud. I had one film photograph (scanned negative) displayed in Milan at the Contrasto Gallery as a finalist.

I'm based in Bali. I feed stray dogs and cats.
