One of ProjectX's core values is to promote work from the community. As we were putting together our site, [projectx.is](https://projectx.is), we realised we needed images. Of course, we didn't need to hit up Unsplash. Nor did we need to look to IG.

We are a community of artists. Our gratification comes from sharing the art that we create. So to break the ice, we sent to the team a call for photographs to adorn our new site.

Here's a short montage of photographs from our first contributors.
