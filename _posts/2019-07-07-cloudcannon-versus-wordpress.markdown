## First Impressions

My very first impression of **CloudCannon** was oxymoronic at best. I was introduced to CloudCannon by a friend just about two months ago. I briefly looked at the CloudCannon site (didn't know anything about *Jekyll* yet) and thought,

> "Oh no, do I really need to *(re)invent* the wheel yet again?"

At the same timeâ€“I was running into a brick wall trying to squeeze every speed optimisation trick in the book out of **WordPress** (bloated themes and WordPress hosting company's included). Dealing with these performance headaches made me reminisce about the good old times when the web was so young (c. 1995). I pondered, why can't I go back and use a static webpage for my home page? Why does WordPress stuff everything into the database only to be spit out again as a static HTML file in the end. Surely, not every page needs to be 100% generated from a database (which is just a big series of flat files as well).

So, there I was. Looking for maybe some sort of hybrid solution when a friend told me their site was hosted on something called CloudCannon.

### TLDR

1. I dreaded the thought of writing *by hand* an entire website in HTML/CSS/JS. *Reinventing* a photo gallery or slider was not appealing to me at all.
2. I grew *complacent* with not having to write much code. But, I suffered on a daily basis working long hours **optimising** about a dozen bloated WordPress sites with minimal gains.

Enough whining. Let's look at the code\!

## What I Like About WordPress

There are a **plethora** of hosting providers, themes, & plugins. Which is also WordPress' dark-side. For example, if I need a homepage hero *slider*, there are many to choose from. If I need an image *gallery* or a *modal popup*, they are almost always built into a premium theme. Easy. I don't need to go into any code to get these widgets up and running fast.

A lot of the widgets and plugins are well designed and sexy. Many are free, freemium, or donation-based.

Having these *conveniences* can also be a curse. See below.
