  ProjectX is a space for artists, photographers, architects, designers etc,
  which will hopefully be the antithesis of the social media platforms.

ProjectX is a platform for in-progress and unfinished projects. There are no deadlines, no likes or retweets and no *algorithms*. It is a space for talking about ideas. Start by leaving details of what you are working on or of a project you have never quite managed to resolve.

ProjectX is a friendly community. Please leave comments that are helpful and supportive. For example, suggest books, work or techniques that you think might help develop the projects posted.

See you in the [project space](https://projectx.is/)\!
