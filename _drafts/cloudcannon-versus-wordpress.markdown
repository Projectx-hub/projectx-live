## First Impressions

My very first impression of **CloudCannon** was oxymoronic at best. I was introduce to CloudCannon just about two months ago. I briefly looked at the CloudCannon site (didn't know anything about *Jekyll* yet) and thought,

> Oh no, do I really need to *(re)invent* the wheel yet again?

At the same time--I was running into a brick wall trying to squeeze every speed optimisation trick in the book out of **WordPress** (bloated themes and WordPress hosting company's included). Dealing with these performance headaches made me reminisce about the good old times when the web was so young (c. 1995). I pondered, why can't I go back and use a static webpage for my home page? Why does WordPress stuff everything into the database only to be spit out again as a static HTML file in the end. Surely, not every page needs to be 100% generated from a database (which is just a big series of flat files as well).

So, there I was. Looking for maybe some sort of hybrid solution when a friend told me their site was hosted on something called CloudCannon.

**TLDR**\: 1) I dreaded the thought of writing *by hand* an entire website in HTML/CSS/JS. *Reinventing* a photo gallery or slider was not appealing to me at all. 2) I grew complacent with not having to write much code. But, I suffered on a daily basis working long hours optimising about a dozen bloated WordPress sites with minimal gains.

Let's get to the comparison bit.
